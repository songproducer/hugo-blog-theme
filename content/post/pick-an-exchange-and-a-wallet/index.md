You can acquire Tezos, (ticker symbol: XTZ) at most popular exchangesÂ  -- like Kraken.com or Binance.com

For large amounts a hardware wallet is recommended:

Ledger Nano S or X, or

Trezor T

On desktop/laptop you can use the Temple wallet browser extension either with your hardware wallet or without.

On mobile you can download either ZenGo (easier and has chat support but no Tezos DeFi) or AirGap Wallet & AirGap Vault (has Tezos DeFi)
